          <p className="portfolio__description">
            I designed and developed the official website for Relo Foods Limited
            to strengthen its digital presence and engage users. The site
            features a four-page layout—Home, About Us, Contact, and Blog—with a
            modern boxed design, smooth gradient background, and vibrant orange
            accents. A dynamic hero section with sliding images and text creates
            an engaging first impression.{" "}
            <p>
              Throughout the project, I collaborated closely with the client,
              incorporating feedback and making adjustments as the project
              evolved. This reinforced my belief that client satisfaction is the
              true measure of success, as delivering exactly what the client
              needs is a direct reflection of your competency.{" "}
            </p>
            The design focused on consistency and user experience, with shared
            headers, subtle animations, and high-quality icons. This project
            gave me experience in end-to-end web development while reinforcing
            the importance of balancing technical skill with client-centric
            communication.

          <p className="portfolio__description">
            InStock is a full-stack inventory management system developed for a
            Fortune 500 client to replace their outdated, underperforming
            platform. Built with React, Express, and MySQL, the application
            delivers a clean, responsive user experience and a backend built for
            scale.
            <br />
            But the real story was the collaboration behind the code. Working as
            part of an Agile team of five, we planned, built, and iterated
            together—using Jira to manage our sprints, align on tasks, and stay
            adaptable through change. Daily standups and constant communication
            taught me how to navigate blockers, support teammates, and keep
            momentum alive.
            <br />
            This experience showed me that great software is a team sport—and
            that thoughtful collaboration is just as essential as clean,
            scalable code.

          This project is a fully responsive, multi-page frontend portfolio website built using React, SCSS (Sass), and Lucide React, and deployed on Vercel. Designed to showcase a woodcraft and joinery business, the site includes structured sections such as a promotional production page with aligned text and imagery, an interactive FAQ with icon-based toggle functionality, a fully validated contact form with CAPTCHA integration, and a well-organized privacy policy page. The layout adapts seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices using custom SCSS with media queries. Styling is implemented using the BEM methodology to ensure modularity and scalability. This project highlights my ability to build clean, user-friendly interfaces with component-based architecture and responsive design principles.
